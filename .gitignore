# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install different versions of dependencies.
#   Hence, Pipfile.lock may differ on different platforms.
#   In such cases, ignore Pipfile.lock and remove the line below to manage dependencies on conflicts
#   manually.
# Pipfile.lock
